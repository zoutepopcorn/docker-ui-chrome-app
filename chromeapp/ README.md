#Building the chrome extension

##Bower
Open a terminal in the folder /chromeapp/. If you have bower:
```
../chromeapp$ bower install
```

**Else first install**
If you dont have bower installed
```
$ npm install -g bower
```
If you don't have npm installed, please google for npm and node.js and make it work...

##Scala
hmm, not working for me @ the moment..
Setup scala (http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Setup.html)
```
../chromeapp$ sbt> compile
```
